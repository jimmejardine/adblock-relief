#How to whitelist a site in your adblocker
To disable your ad blocker for the website you are currently visiting, follow the instructions below. Instructions will vary depending on which ad-blocking device you have installed.  Also please take care that if you are running multiple adblockers, you will need to whitelist the site in each of them.

Click on 'Enabled on this site' to show 'Disabled on this site'.  **NB:** AdBlock sometimes ignores your whitelist if you type a website name directly into Chrome.  To work around this problem, you can refresh the page, create a bookmark/favourite to the page, or upgrade to a more efficient and bug-free adblocker, such as uBlock.|
